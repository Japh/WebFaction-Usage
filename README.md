WebFaction Usage
================

WebFaction script / web interface to monitor resource usage.

## How to install

Check the repository out into a web accessible directory, then add this to your crontab:

`* * * * * /home/<username>/webapps/<app name>/<path>/memlogger`

Also replace `japheth` with your username in the _memlogger_ script, and any appropriate paths.

## TODO

* Make this more generic and give it a config file.
* OOP it.
